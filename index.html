            <img src="images/section 1 image.jpg" alt="history">
            <p>Grocies Store is a supermarket chain that originated in Sri Lanka. It is owned and operated by ABC Company, a major Sri lankan retail company. Grocies Stores typically focus on offering fresh produce, groceries, and household items at affordable prices. The chain has expanded significantly since its inception, with numerous outlets across Sri Lanka, catering to the needs of local consumers. In 2015, Grocies Store opened it's first branch in Kollupitiya as a response to the growing demand for high-quality, affordable groceries in urban and suburban areas. Today, Grocies Store is a thriving regional chain with branches across the country. Despite its growth, the company remains true to its founders' vision, continuing to prioritize quality, sustainability, and customer satisfaction above all else. With its deep roots in the communities it serves, Grocies Store has become more than just a place to shop—it's a trusted partner in helping families eat well and live healthier lives.

It targeted urban centers, suburban areas, and growing neighborhoods where there was a lack of quality supermarkets or where existing options were not meeting consumer needs.</li>
                <li><div>Partnerships with Local Suppliers:</div>  Grocies Store prioritized partnerships with local farmers, producers, and suppliers to ensure a steady supply of fresh, high-quality products.

                <li><div>Focus on Customer Experience:</div>  Grocies Store prioritized providing exceptional customer experiences in its new stores.
